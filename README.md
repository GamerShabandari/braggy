# Braggy
This mobile game was made for my thesis assignment at Medieinstitutet. Its a game where you guess the results of all the fixtures in the upcoming round of the Premier League.

You swipe the card to the side you think will win the fixture, and swipe up if you think it will be a draw.

You have 20 seconds to guess all the fixtures, hurry up and try to guess them all right and chase a highscore to brag about to your friends!
