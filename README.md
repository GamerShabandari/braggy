# Braggy
This mobile game was made for my thesis assignment at Medieinstitutet. Its a game where you guess the results of all the fixtures in the upcoming round of the Premier League.

- You swipe the card to the side you think will win the fixture, and swipe up if you think it will be a draw.
- You have 30 seconds to guess all the fixtures, hurry up and try to guess them all right and chase a highscore to brag about to your friends!

I wanted to focus on the frontend part during this assignment so all the data storage is handled via LocalStorage clientside.

# Good to know
- Since the game is dependent of Premier League matchdays to be played before the player can se the results & history of played game/games I have implemented functions for faking a result for demonstration purposes.
To test a fake result there are two buttons at the bottom of the page, first the player need to play a round, when back at main page first click the "1: Fake" button. Now the fake results have been generated.
Now click the "2: Check" button to simulate UI/UX when results are in.

- The API used has had some issues during development where some fixtures and results where lost and caused issues with app-logic. To adress this there is a function that supplies fake data if the API is having problems.
